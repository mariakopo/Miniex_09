ยง Which API have you chosen? and Why?

I have choosen the Open Weather Data - API since I thought it was simply. 


ยง Can you describe your process of making this mini exercise in terms of acquiring, processing, using and representing data?

I thought it was really difficult because I had a lot of trouble with the API and the API-key. For me the proces was vrey frustrating since I really tried and used a lot of time to make it work. Therefore my program is very simple also in the coding. I would have made a lot more interesting things with the program but my time ran out, so this is what I could make. 


ยง What is your reflection on the aesthetics of (big) data?

I think working with the API and using other data from another site is very useful and can make a program more interesting and not just for the visual. You can really use the API to create something where you can compare and creating something more relevant for the user.
